# Project Intro/Objective
The Brigade Project Index is designed to create a searchable repository of projects, current and past, created within the Code for America brigade network.

We want to empower projects and brigades to draw in collaborators. We want to empower volunteers, community organizations, and governments to discover and leverage the work that's already being done. People can't connect with something they can't find.

# Getting Involved


1. Review Github where we track pieces of work and have specific discussions:
https://github.com/codeforamerica/brigade-project-index/projects/1

2. Review the Google Drive for meeting agendas and notes:
https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1yaJe0QQSEw_fKljTJ719o9hQlJAKwGr5

3. Join the Slack that we use as primary means of communication:
https://cfa.slack.com on the #brigade-project-index channel

<!-- What's the 'onboarding document'? Isn't this the onboarding document? -->
4. Get invited to the meeting! Every 2 weeks, Sunday at 6pm. After reviewing the onboarding document, drop a request in the slack channel to be included.

5. For more context, feel free to read through the discourse topic that outlines much of the historical work done around this project:

# MVP

The current mvp is based on the [user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story) we've created on this github repo (https://github.com/codeforamerica/brigade-project-index/projects/2). It focuses on leveraging github because it's a central tool for many projects in the brigade network. The MVP includes the following pieces:
<!-- What does 'best practices' mean in this context? Best github practices in general? Best practice for making tags and descriptions? Best practices for some kind of other meta data methodology? -->

<!-- What implementation is this section talking about when it says that 'high github literacy is fundamental to a successful implementation'? Our implementation of the MVP? Literacy for brigades/projects who want to use/implement the MVP? Something else? -->
* Education on github best practices, tagging, and descriptions. User research will be needed to determine how native github metadata can be a source of the project info, but the team agrees that high github literacy is fundamental to a successful implementation.
* A taxonomy for skills and interests to allow for standardized grouping and searching of projects.
<!-- For making sure that people are using the right words or for making sure people continue to use tags when making projects? -->
* A methodology (e.g. working group?) for maintaining taxonomies.
<!-- If I'm not misunderstanding, this sounds a lot like making a taxonomy. Is this trying to talk about establishing a standard data structure? -->
* A defined set of metadata describing projects, potentially defined as a json file.
* A site that hosts a UI for a searchable list of projects.


# Future Considerations
* How can we extend this for projects that don't involve code and/or are made in platforms other than github? For example, ones based in google docs.


# Project Description

## Technologies Used
* Github

## Guiding Principles
* Have an open and accessible process with outreach, documentation, public discussions, and transparent decisions.
* Enable grassroots-driven projects across the brigade network with the minimum number of barriers (technical and otherwise) to inclusion in the index.
